🏴 Uses lab report inputs (Age, Fever, SpO₂, WBC, CRP, etc.)

🏴 Predicts Pneumonia Risk → Low | Moderate | High

🏴 Uploads medical datasets to calculate Total Patients

🏴 Shows Pneumonia-positive vs Normal patient analytics

🟢 Core Strengths

🏴DNN-based medical prediction

🏴Flask-powered web interface

🏴Real-time risk probability

🏴Automated dataset analysis

🏴Healthcare decision support

🟢 Why It Matters

Enables early pneumonia screening, data-driven insights, and faster medical decisions using AI + lab reports.
